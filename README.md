# Space Invaders Game
 "Space Invaders", a classic arcane game, is the fourth game in my series of games that I'll try to produce without following any tutorials. The only outside reference being the Unity documentation.

I ran into a small issue which had me stumped for a good hour before I decided to post a question on gamedev.stackexchange... and I'm glad I did, since I probably wouldn't have figured it for a good few hours more. Any questions that I ask on stackexchange will be listed below.
